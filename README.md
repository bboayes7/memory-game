# Memory Game Project

## Description

Simple Memory Game used with Udacity's Starter Code. The project was to test how effectively I can use HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
in one project. The biggest thing I learned was how to use the DOM with eventlisteners more effectively, how to use setInterval, and how to manipulate the CSS when an event occurs. Biggest issues are the game breaking bugs you see on the known issues section. 

The game begins when the page starts up and press the play button.

Flip over two hidden cards at a time to locate the ones that match.
The more moves you make and the more time passes the less star rating you will receive. The lowest star rating will be one star. 

To get started run the index.html on your browser and start playing.

## Known Issues

 1. click all the cards like crazy

 When the game breaks, just press the restart button.
